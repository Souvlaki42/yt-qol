# YouTube Timestamp Saver

Are you angry because your browser just refreshed the YouTube video you were watching, after switching tabs?<br>
If the answer is yes, then you are in the right place.<br>
This small browser extension solves this problem for you, by storing the timestamp of the video in the URL.<br>
It does that when you pause or lose tab focus.<br>
It's currently tested only on Chromium-based browser like Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge or Brave.<br>
It should work for Firebox as well but I didn't test it.<br>
