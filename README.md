# YT QOL 1.5

Are you angry because your browser just refreshed the YouTube video you were watching, after switching tabs? \
If the answer is yes, then you are in the right place. \
This small browser extension solves this problem for you, by storing the timestamp of the video in the URL. \
It does that when you pause the playback of the video. \
It's currently tested only on Chromium-based browser like Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Arc or Brave. \
It should work on Firefox on firefox as well. Not tested though. \

# New

I just added '\' as a keyboard shortcut to click the "Skip ad" button. \
A lot of automation is added to the releases as well.
