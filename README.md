# YouTube Timestamp Saver

Are you angry because your browser just refreshed the YouTube video you were watching, after switching tabs for a while?<br>
If the answer is yes, then you are in the right place.<br>
This small still unpublished browser extension aims to solve this problem for you, by storing the timmestamp of the video in the URL<br>
It does that when you pause or lose tab focus<br>
It's currently tested only on Chromium-based browser like Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge or Brave<br>
It should work for Firebox as well but I didn't test it<br>
