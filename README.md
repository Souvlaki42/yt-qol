# YouTube Timestamp Saver

Are you angry because your browser just refreshed the YouTube video you were watching, after switching tabs for a while?
If the answer is yes, then you are in the right place.
This small still unpublished browser extension aims to solve this problem for you, by storing the timmestamp of the video in the URL.
It does that when you pause or lose tab focus.
It's currently tested only on Chromium-based browser like Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge or Brave.
It should work for Firebox as well but I didn't test it.
